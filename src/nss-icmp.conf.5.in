.TH NSS-ICMP.CONF 5 "12 Jan 2006" "icmpdn @VERSION@" "ICMP Hostname Manual"
.SH NAME
nss-icmp.conf - Configuration file for the nss-icmp nameswitch module
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/nss-icmp.conf\fP is an ASCII file which controls certain
operating parameters for the \fBnss-icmp\fP(7) nameswitch module. Each
line in the file takes the form of a key-value pair, seperated by
whitespace. Some keys may not have a value. Lines beginning with a
hash sign (#) are interpreted as comments, and thus ignored.
.P
Valid entries are:
.TP
\fBtimeout\fP \fImilliseconds\fP
Instructs \fBnss-icmp\fP to pass the -t option to \fBidnlookup\fP(1),
which changes the default time-out for nonresponsive hosts to the
specified number of milliseconds.
.TP
\fBttlnotfount\fP \fIseconds\fP
Specifies the TTL (Time-to-Live) value to use when caching a
non-responsive host. In other word, if a host is found to be
non-responsive (i.e. times out), the same address will not retried
again until the specified time has passed, as to prevent annoying
time-outs.
.TP
\fBnocache\fP
If this directive is present, \fBnss-icmp\fP will not use its
cache. Since this makes reverse hostname lookups slower, especially in
the case of non-responsive hosts, the use of this directive is
generally not recommended, but may be useful in certain debugging
situtations.
